## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
1. Install MySQL Server.
2. Create a new database named `QuizGenerationAssessment`.
3. Import the schema file `QuizGenerationAssessment Schema.sql` located in the root directory.

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend requires a local LLM model to function.

1. Navigate to `quiz_backend_rag/`.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Download the Model**:
   - Download `Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf` (approx 2.4GB).
   - Place it in: `quiz_backend_rag/ml_model/`.
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

### 3. Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to `quiz_frontend/`.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
